# CustomStripe
Use a custom payment button for Stripe Checkout, instead of the blue default Stripe button. 

This code is used for creating your own custom button instead of using the pre-made "Stripe Checkout" button.

The idea is that the CLASS of the Stripe Payment Button is "stripe-button-el",

So we add a button that onclick fires a function that will "click" the Stripe class.


Here is the JS FIDDLE, however, jsfiddle has issues and it wont work like the HTML file will.
